# Customer Retention & Churn Analysis for a Consumer Subscription Startup (Using R)

# Project Overview
A subscription start up is growing fast, but something feels off. New customers sign up every day, yet revenue growth is sluggish. The culprit? Customer churn ,the silent killer of subscription businesses. This project tells the story of how I turned raw data into actionable insights to answer one critical question: Why are customers leaving, and how can we keep them? By analyzing customer behavior, acquisition channels and product usage patterns, I uncovered retention drivers and built a roadmap for reducing churn and boosting lifetime value


# Business Context

For subscription-based start ups, churn is like a leak in a bucket.you can keep pouring in new customers but if they leave quickly, growth stalls. Every lost customer means wasted marketing spend and missed revenue. The challenge wasn’t just measuring churn. it was understanding who leaves, when and why. This analysis aimed to transform uncertainty into clarity, giving decision-makers the power to act.

# Business Objectives

To solve this, I focused on four key goals:

- Measure churn and understand its scale
- Compare retention between subscription and one-time buyers
- Identify acquisition channels that bring loyal customers
- Analyze product influence on retention
